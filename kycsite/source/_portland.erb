				<h3>PORTLAND 101</h3>
				<p class="quote2">Love Portland’s lefty politics? Then this is the tour for you!</p>
				<p class="tourtext">Connecting Portland’s political institutions, politicians and policies, this walking tour provides an inside look at the city and the key political factors that shaped it. Through this tour, we'll learn the stories of ordinary people that influenced urban planning, style, and attitudes, while looking at how the built environment can be linked to our city's political history. Portland 101 is a primer for those wanting to know more about Portland, its quirky character, and the progressive policy the city is internationally known for today.</p>
