			<p class="quote2 cushycms">Sick of big box stores and corporate chains? Welcome to Portland, OR, USA—Home to all things independent!</p>
			<p class="tourtext cushycms">This walking tour is designed for those seeking to connect with the true, homespun culture of the city (which can sometimes be tough to find as a visitor).
			Along the way, we'll meet with some of the personalities that contribute to Portland's artisan and DIY culture, and we'll also explore some of the key policies
			that help foster these independent businesses. DIY PDX introduces tour-goers to our grassroots culture that embraces local self-reliance and sustainable living—and that defines Portland's independent ethos.</p>
